# Tech-Blog

## Description
This project is a Tech blog written with node.js in the back end and handlebars was used to create front-end. I used express.js to create RESTfull APIs and configured it to use Sequelize to handle MySQL database. The user can sign in and sign-up and create new post after sign in. The user can also update posts, delete posts and add comments. The site was deployed to Heroku.
